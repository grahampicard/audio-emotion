# Getting started
Because of size limitations, we can't include all our audio files in the github repo. In order for this to work, you'll need to first download all of the raw files (e.g. `CAL500_32kps`) that are stored in our box.com account under `CAL500 Data (drop this into data-raw of recreation paper)`. Then, run files accordingly. 

# Folder Structure

```
|---Data
|    |---   raw:        extracts from CAL500 dataset
|    |---   interim:    pre-processed data
|    |---   final:      processed data / data for sharing
|---Models
